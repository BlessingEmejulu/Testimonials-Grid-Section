Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h2>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h2>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Useful resources

- [How to Take the Right Approach to Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/taking-the-right-approach-to-responsive-web-design/) - This helped me to understand how to use media quries and right units for responsive web design. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
