        <h2>
          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny’s worth.
        </h2>

        <q>I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
          completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working
          as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</q>

        <q>
          started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now
          work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of the
          best investments I’ve made in myself.</q>

        <h2>
          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
          Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
          easy.
        </h2>

        <q>The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find
          really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to
          be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
          junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
          personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart
          and amazing people.</q>

        <h2>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>

        <q>Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I
          needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
          program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
          were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
          agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
          learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
          have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
          example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
          job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
          recommend!</q>
